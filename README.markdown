--------

Regardless of your operating system, you must have the following things installed on it and included in your path:

  * JRE 1.5 or greater
  * Maven 2.x or greater
  * Git

Under Windows platform you also must have:

  * NSIS 2.x or greater

Open a system shell and check out the sources into some directory. Then `cd` into that directory and type:

  `mvn clean package`

The resulting built artifacts will be located under the `target` directory. That's it.
